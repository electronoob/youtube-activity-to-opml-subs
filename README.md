# youtube-activity-to-opml-subs

this is a dump of my youtube watch history from around 2014 to present day, it would seem.

i am a bit confused as i didnt always have watch history enabled in google account settings, but there's too much data for me to bother trying to figure out if there are gaps or not. 

that said there's about 16500 videos listed in this file that ive watched and more than 5000 unique channels. 

im going to load the 5000+ subscriptions into newpipe on android and see if there is anything interesting that comes up, since youtube has a circular buffer of only 1000 subscriptions and it's always full for me. 

i used to export the opml subscriptions file from yt periodically and ended up with 2500 subscriptions in my news reader but i had lost that data at some point and i think ive basically been able to regenerate that subscription list now and some.
